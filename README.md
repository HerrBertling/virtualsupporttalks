## Hey Kevin :wave:

As you can see, the project is basically a standard Nuxt project. If you start the dev server via `yarn dev`, you'll hopefully also notice that it tries to handle all of the markdown files, pdfs, yaml,â€¦ etc. which is really strange and I think should not happen? I'm out of my depth here, so thanks for having a look!

Also, hope you don't mind all the german stuff :sweat_smile:
