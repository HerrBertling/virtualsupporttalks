## Notes & Issues
- Each commit should maintain a working, deployable state
- Test thoroughly after each step
- Document any issues or deviations from the original plan
- Keep track of any additional changes discovered during migration

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise, rollback to the previous working commit and reassess the problematic step.
