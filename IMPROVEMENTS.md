- **Current Type Errors**: 0 ‚úÖ (Fixed in PR #332)
- **Current Lint Errors**: 2
- **Test Coverage**: Minimal (1 test file)
- **Outdated Dependencies**: 37+
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: 22 (1 critical, 4 high, 11 moderate, 6 low)
- **Node Version**: >=22.2.0

---

## üî¥ Critical Priority

### 1. ‚úÖ Fix TypeScript Errors (COMPLETED)

**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed in PRs #331 and #332

**Impact**: High - Type safety is compromised, potential runtime errors

**Completed Tasks**:

- [x] Fix null assignment type errors in `SpeakingTimeContent.tsx:275-279`
- [x] Fix `Document` type mismatches in `SpeakingTimeContent.tsx:283`
- [x] Add proper type guards for `page` property in route loaders
- [x] Fix meta function type signature in blog post route
- [x] Add proper type assertions for Contentful fields that are currently typed as `any`
- [x] Fix array iteration type issues in tag filtering
- [x] Remove unused `app/utils/i18n.ts` file

**Actual effort**: ~4 hours

---

### 1b. Fix Security Vulnerabilities (22 vulnerabilities)

**Impact**: High - Security risks, potential exploits

**Issue**: GitHub Dependabot detected 22 vulnerabilities:
- 1 critical severity
- 4 high severity
- 11 moderate severity
- 6 low severity

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Review Dependabot security alerts at https://github.com/HerrBertling/virtualsupporttalks/security/dependabot
- [ ] Update vulnerable dependencies (prioritize critical and high severity)
- [ ] Test application after security updates
- [ ] Verify no breaking changes from dependency updates
- [ ] Consider enabling Dependabot auto-updates for security patches

**Estimated effort**: 2-3 hours

---

### 2. Migrate to Biome for Linting and Formatting

**Impact**: High - Currently no working linter for project files, plus faster tooling

**Issue**: ESLint parsing errors in `getContentfulEnvironment.js` and `tailwind.config.js` suggest missing or misconfigured setup. Biome is significantly faster than ESLint (10-100x) and can replace both ESLint and Prettier.

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Install Biome: `npm install --save-dev --save-exact @biomejs/biome`
- [ ] Initialize Biome: `npx @biomejs/biome init`
- [ ] Configure `biome.json` with:
  - [ ] TypeScript and React support
  - [ ] JSX accessibility rules
  - [ ] Import sorting
  - [ ] Formatting rules (matching current Prettier if any)
- [ ] Remove ESLint and Prettier dependencies (if replacing completely)
- [ ] Update npm scripts:
  - [ ] `"lint": "biome check ."`
  - [ ] `"lint:fix": "biome check --write ."`
  - [ ] `"format": "biome format --write ."`
- [ ] Fix existing lint/format errors
- [ ] Add pre-commit hook using Biome (husky + lint-staged)
- [ ] Update CI/CD to use Biome

**Benefits**:

- Single tool for both linting and formatting
- 10-100x faster than ESLint/Prettier
- Better TypeScript support out of the box
- No complex config needed

**Note**: The auto-formatting will likely touch many files. Consider doing this in a separate PR that's clearly marked as "formatting only" to make future PRs easier to review.

**Estimated effort**: 2-3 hours

---

### 3. Create Missing `.env.template`

**Impact**: Medium - New developers cannot easily set up the project

**Issue**: README.md references `.env.template` but file doesn't exist.

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Create `.env.template` with all required variables:
  ```
  CONTENTFUL_SPACE=
  CONTENTFUL_ACCESSTOKEN=
  CONTENTFUL_ENVIRONMENT=master
  CONTENTFUL_MANAGEMENT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN=
  ```
- [ ] Ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore` (‚úì already done)
- [ ] Add comments explaining where to find each value

**Estimated effort**: 15 minutes

---

### 4. Remove Type Assertions (`as any`)

**Impact**: High - Type safety bypass, defeats TypeScript purpose

**Issue**: Extensive use of `as any` in `ContentBlocks.tsx` (lines 39, 52, 64, 77, 98, 114, 130, 142, 154, 159, 171, 185, 199)

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Create proper TypeScript discriminated union types for content blocks
- [ ] Use type guards instead of `as any` assertions
- [ ] Create helper functions with proper type narrowing
- [ ] Consider using Contentful's generated types more effectively

**Example refactor**:

```typescript
// Instead of: const { content } = item!.fields as any;
// Use proper type narrowing:
if (
  id === "centeredContent" &&
  item.sys.contentType.sys.id === "centeredContent"
) {
  const block = item as Entry<TypeCenteredContentSkeleton>;
  const { content, bgcolor } = block.fields;
  // ... rest of logic
}
```

**Estimated effort**: 6-8 hours

---
